Unity Kata #11 - Memory

What is memory:
	- Test of one's skill to remember the position of tiles
	- Tiles have values, every unique value appears twice among the tiles
	- Tile number is always even
	- Tiles are turned faced down at beginning
	- Player flips two tiles, if they share a value, they stay flipped

Current features:
 * basic memory game

ToDo:
- move system connection from ui to master
- figure out number of rows & columns
- simplify loadMemoryTiles (or extract stuff to make it readable)
- add delay before re-covering tile content
- implement switch between players = turns
- implement marking of current playername
- add result menu
- create menu for adding players
- scale playername font size
- implement algorithm that automatically fills PlayerProfilePositions
- randomize tiles
- use image instead of number
